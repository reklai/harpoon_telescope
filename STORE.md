**Stop losing tabs. Start navigating.**

Harpoon Telescope gives you three tools to take control of your browser tabs — no mouse required.

**Pin your key tabs**
Anchor up to 4 tabs to numbered slots. Jump to any of them instantly with a keyboard shortcut. Your scroll position is saved and restored automatically, so you land exactly where you left off. If a pinned tab gets closed, it reopens in place when you jump to it.

**Search the current page**
Press Alt+F to open a fast, fuzzy search overlay on any page. Results appear as you type, with a live preview pane showing the matched line in context. Use filters to narrow results by type:
- /headings — find section headers
- /links — find links
- /code — find code blocks
Filters combine freely: "/code /links api" searches both code and links for "api."

**Switch tabs by frequency**
Press Alt+Shift+F to see your most-used tabs ranked by how often and how recently you visit them. Type to filter the list by title or URL. Jump to any tab with Enter.

**Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts**
Every keybinding can be changed in the options page. Collision detection warns you before you create conflicts.

**Optional vim motions**
Toggle vim-enhanced navigation with Alt+V. This adds j/k movement on top of the standard arrow keys — it never replaces them. A badge in the panel titlebar shows whether vim mode is on or off.

**Sessions**
Save your current set of pinned tabs as a named session. Load it later to restore your workspace. Keep up to 4 sessions.

**Privacy-first**
No data leaves your browser. No analytics, no tracking, no network requests. Everything is stored locally. See the full privacy policy for details.

Works on Firefox, Chrome, and Zen Browser.

## Additional notes for Chrome Web Store "Why do you need these permissions?"

- **tabs**: Read tab titles and URLs so the extension can display them in the tab manager and frecency list, and switch between tabs on your behalf.
- **activeTab**: Access the current page content to power the in-page search feature (Telescope).
- **bookmarks**: Browse, create, move, and remove bookmarks from the extension overlays.
- **history**: Read and remove history entries from the extension history panel.
- **storage**: Save your pinned tabs, sessions, frecency data, and keyboard shortcut preferences locally in the browser.
- **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: Inject the content script on every page so keyboard shortcuts and search overlays work everywhere.
